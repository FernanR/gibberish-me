gibberish.js is the commented source code.
gibberishcomp.js was compiled using closure and is typically what's powering the site.

    To do for interface:
        - make experiment page
        - make the main page more intuitive (change button structure)
    
    To do for gibberish.js:
        - clean input
        - add a page allowing users to experiment with different settings
        - generalize to accept any number of prefixes
        - generalize to ignore punctuation
        - allow visualization of gibberTable data
